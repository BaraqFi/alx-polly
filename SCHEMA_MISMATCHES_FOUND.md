# Database Schema Mismatches Found and Fixed

## Issues Identified:

### 1. **Polls Table**
- ❌ **Missing `title` column** - Application uses `question` but database expects `title`
- ❌ **Missing `options` column** - Application expects TEXT[] array
- ❌ **Missing `created_by` column** - Application uses `user_id` but database has `created_by`
- ❌ **Missing `is_active` column** - Application expects boolean for soft deletes
- ❌ **Missing `created_at` column** - Application expects timestamp
- ❌ **Missing `updated_at` column** - Application expects timestamp

### 2. **Votes Table**
- ❌ **Missing `poll_id` column** - Application expects UUID foreign key
- ❌ **Missing `user_id` column** - Application expects UUID foreign key
- ❌ **Missing `option_index` column** - Application expects INTEGER
- ❌ **Missing `created_at` column** - Application expects timestamp

### 3. **Profiles Table**
- ❌ **Missing entirely** - Admin page tries to join with profiles table
- ❌ **No user profile management** - No way to store user names/emails

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Code Changes**
- ✅ Updated all `question` references to `title`
- ✅ Updated all `user_id` references to `created_by` for polls
- ✅ Added null checks for `options` arrays
- ✅ Added fallbacks for missing profile data
- ✅ Fixed Next.js 15 params handling

### 2. **Database Schema**
- ✅ Created comprehensive schema fix script
- ✅ Added all missing columns with proper types
- ✅ Created profiles table for user information
- ✅ Added RLS policies for security
- ✅ Added triggers for automatic profile creation

## Files Modified:
- `app/lib/actions/poll-actions.ts` - All CRUD operations
- `app/(dashboard)/polls/PollActions.tsx` - Poll display
- `app/(dashboard)/polls/[id]/PollVoteComponent.tsx` - Voting

## Next Steps:
1. Run `comprehensive-schema-fix.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Test poll creation, voting, and editing
3. Verify admin panel works correctly
4. Check that all security fixes are still in place
